### TURN API

Node.js app that polls a Cassandra database for the most recent utilization available about available TURN servers in the cluster and provides a web API for clients to query in order to get a list of available TURN servers sorted in order of least-utilized. 

### Prerequsites

git
node.js
forever
Cassandra

/opt/logs directory (writeable by the user account that will run the server process)


The installation instructions for these items is beyond the scope of this readme file.



### Installation and configuration 


```
cd /opt/
sudo git clone https://YOUR_GIT_USERNAME@github.com/CommsOps/turn_api.git
cd /opt/turn_api
sudo npm install
```


Configuration files for are stored in the  /config folder. Every logical data center location should have its own configuration file.  If necessary, create a new configuration file with an appropriate environment or data center suffix. (for example, wbrn, stg, qa2)


Sample configuration:

```
module.exports = { 

  cassandra_config : {
    hosts : ['96.119.5.69'],
    keyspace : 'turn_stats_db'
  },
  
  max_server_count: 1

}
```

Explanation:

hosts:  list of IP addresses of Cassandra hosts that this instances should communicate with.  In our default case, we list the local data center host first, and the other data center cassandra host second.

keyspace:  the Cassandra keyspace (database) name

max_server_count:   number of TURN servers to return when a client requests available turn resources


### Execution

The init script is located in the scripts directory of this repository.  It will need to be modified to load the correct configuration file. 

The environment variable NODE_ENV needs to be set with an environment name that matches its corresponding config in config. For example, to load config_wbrn.js set NODE_ENV to "wbrn", to load config_qa2.js set NODE_ENV to "qa2".
